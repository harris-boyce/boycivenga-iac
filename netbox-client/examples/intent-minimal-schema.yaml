# NetBox Minimal Intent Schema - Example Configuration
# This file demonstrates the minimal set of NetBox objects required
# for basic network intent management across multiple sites.
#
# This example includes:
# - Sites: Physical locations for network infrastructure
# - Prefixes: IP address ranges associated with sites and VLANs
# - VLANs: Virtual LANs for network segmentation
# - Tags: Optional metadata for organizing resources
#
# Usage:
#   python netbox-client/scripts/post_minimal_intent.py

# IP prefixes define network ranges and associate them with sites and VLANs

# VLANs provide network segmentation within sites

# Tags can be used to categorize and filter resources (optional)
